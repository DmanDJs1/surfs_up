## Climate Analysis for W. Avy
The purpose of this analysis was to aid our potential partner and investor W. Avy in making the right decision utilizing statistical analysis of weather patterns. 
He has asked us to perform a climate analysis on different locations in the beautiful Island of Oahu, Hawaii. 
He wants to know where it would be best to locate this business and is counting on us to provide him with solid statistical analysis of weather patterns to support his decision. 
After the first phase of our initial analysis, he has requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
• The average temperatures for both months were very similar with June being 74 ℉and December being 71℉

• The maximum temperature for the months of June and December were 85 ℉ and 83 ℉ respectively

• The minimum temperatures for the months of June and December were 64 ℉ and 56℉ respectively

## Conclusion:
Our results have indicated that there were no real differences between the two months and the surf shop is a great investment year-round given our results from the analysis. The client can feel confident in his choice of location for this business venture.
